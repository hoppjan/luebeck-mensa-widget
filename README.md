1. Commit that change (`git commit -am v1.2.3`)
1. Tag the commit (`git tag v1.2.3`). Make sure your tag name's format is `v*.*.*`
1. Push the changes to GitHub (`git push && git push --tags`)

After building successfully, the action will publish the release artifacts in a new release draft that will be created on GitHub with download links for the app.
